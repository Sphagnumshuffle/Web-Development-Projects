                    This project is also done utilizing awesome
                    benefits provided by CSS grid. I've been experimenting
                    with Flexbox previously but in my opinion I find CSS grid
                    is more versatile than Flexbox. But hey, you can also combine
                    both of them and take advantage of pros in each. Strap in and 
                    let's get started!

                <p>
                    Well that is an excellent question to get started with! It is 
                    always a great approach to be interested in new(ish) technologies
                    and think about how you can use them in your own projects. My 
                    programming background is in Data Science and I love that field but 
                    I also think that the Web Development field is super interesting
                    and I hope that if I get fluent in this field that I somehow
                    find a way to combine these two fields together. I work
                    as a Developer in big ICT company in Finland and I get to do 
                    50% of my time Data Science and another half is devoted to 
                    Synthetic Monitoring development.

                    I currently follow the curriculum from FreeCodeCamp and I'm 
                    enjoying it so far. This is one of their required projects in 
                    order to receive the first certificate (Responsive Web Design
                    or something like that). So this project is supposed to be a 
                    techinal documentation of something and I chose to write it about
                    CSS grid in order to boost my CSS grid knowledge. Let's make it clear
                    here that I'm not designer in any kind of level and making appealing
                    interfaces is still pretty big mystery for me. But hey, I'm here to 
                    learn and I intend to learn stuff so that my sites and applications
                    look nice and appealing to users. But I think that you are 
                    already getting tired of hearing about me, let's dive in to
                    CSS Grid!

                    <header>Why use CSS Grid</header>
                <p>
                    Well, that is an excellent question my friend! First of all
                    CSS grid allows you to modify your lements in <i>both</i> vertically
                    and horizontally. You can't do this with flexbox, so CSS Grid takes 
                    the lead here. But you don't have to count out either because they
                    synergize pretty well. Flexbox has better browser support but I 
                    sincerely hope that CSS Grid gets that kind of browser support fast (
                    or maybe it already has)
                </p>
                <p>I personally find that CSS Grid makes it easier to design your 
                    page layout. You can just split it into different sized boxes.
                    And the great part here is that you can easily swap the order of 
                    the boxes, so if you want to change layout in the fly it is very 
                    much possible utilizing CSS Grid. CSS Grid also has some own tips and 
                    tricks to make your web pages responsible using media queries and CSS 
                    Grids own special element properties. But we well get there eventually 
                    if you manage to tag along for so long.

                    <header>How do I use this great CSS Grid</header>
                <p>
                    Well it is pretty easy if you are familiar with the Flexbox.
                    You just basically assign your parent element (usually class or id
                    of it is named "container" or "wrapper") and tada! Congrats, you just
                    created a simple CSS Grid. Here is an example how to put in use in 
                    css-file:<br><br>
                <code>
                    .container { <br>
                        display: grid;<br>
                    } 
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>Sure this doesn't do pretty much anything if you did the previous step. You
                    can alter how many columns and rows your CSS Grid container or wrapper includes.
                    Here is a simple example where I split the page horizontally into two spaces;
                    smaller for navigation element and bigger for the main content:<br><br>
                <code>
                    .container { <br>
                        display: grid;<br>
                        grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr;<br>
                    }
                    </code> <br><br>
                    Here I just created a split where I emphatize that navigation
                    takes 1 fraction of designated space and content takes 4 fractions.
                    I made this because I want to show that the content is more important
                    and should always take 4/5 fractions compared to navigations 1/5 fraction.
                </p>
                <p>So there I split the page into two different portions horizontally. Now I 
                    need to do the same vertically. Lucky for us, it is very similar to the previous
                    split (which was horizontal). So we just replace the word column with row:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        .container { <br>
                            display: grid;<br>
                            grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr;<br>
                            grid-template-rows 100px 150px;<br>
                            } <br>
                    </code><br> 
                    Easy as that! Next up; change the order of our grid items in container/wrapper. 
                    This one is also very handy feature of CSS Grid and it makes super easy to alter
                    the layout of your page. You give items in your parent container or wrapper grid-area name
                    which you use in one of great CSS properties. Here I'm going to stick with our example
                    where I have to columns; navigation and main-section. Note that these are divs in my 
                    html and therefore I use dot-sign in front of them in examples. Here is how I point names
                    to my items in container:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        .navigation {<br>
                            grid-area: navigation;<br>
                        } <br><br>
                        .content {<br>
                        grid-area: content;<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code><br>
                    So how do I change to order of my items in layout? I'm going to show you my correct layout and opposite of it in 
                    the next example. This is my preferred layout order:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        .container {<br>
                            display: grid;<br>
                            grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr;<br>
                            grid-template-areas: <br>
                            "navigation content";<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code><br>
                    You can see that I used the grid-template-areas here to arrange the items as I see fit. Note that we used our 
                    previously defined grid-area values in the grid-template-areas property. Now if I wanted to change the order
                    to opposite that would be easy to do, like this:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        .container {<br>
                            display: grid;<br>
                            grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr;<br>
                            grid-template-areas: <br>
                            "content navigation";<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code><br>
                    Here you can see that I just swapped the places of content and navigation in grid-template-areas and the 
                    layout is now completely different compared to the first and actually it is opposite. See how simple
                    and easy that was!

                    This was just a teaser for CSS Grid but if I get positive feedback
                    about it I might consider doing longer tutorial/techical documentation. Here are some short
                    tips to keep you coding:<br><br> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep coding everyday, even 20 minutes is fine</li>
                        <li>Keep your passion lit</li>
                        <li>Get in the coding zone by reading interesting coding articles/books</li>
                        <li>Do your own side projects</li>
                        <li>Remember to rest well</li>
                        <li>Do also other stuff you love, for example video games, play ice-hockey, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Happy coding!</p>
