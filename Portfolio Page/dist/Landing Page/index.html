        <h3>Data Analysis and Modeling</h3>
        <p>Did you to go college and attend to statistical class long ago? Those times when you were
            young and you had no rush anywhere? This might scare you, but world has changed a lot since then.
            World has took advantage of new statistical methods and people talk about these things with cool
            buzzwords such as Machine Learning and AI. But if you did your statistic course well then you
            already know at least one Machine Learning algorithm: Linear regression. Of course we are going
            to use best and most efficient methods based on every situation. We take advantage of latest
            and greatest Machine Learning algorithms and if you have enough data we might even use Neural
            Networks.

        <h3>Predictions and Forecasting</h3>
        <p>Have you ever considered how you could leverage your data and get Business Value out of it? We
            use aforementioned models to analyse your data and based on that we create a model that describes
            your data well. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After that we use our model in order to predict valuable things for you such as Revenue and 
            Churn rate. We can also create a forecast from model to predict future (or more likely to give
            our best refined guess about it). For example we can predict stock prizes based on historical data 
            and then you can take advantage of it and become a millioner.
